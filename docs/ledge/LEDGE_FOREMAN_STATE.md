Revision 0027 independently accepts the completed
`A004-SHARED-COMPOSITOR-FIRST-SYNC-R4` Reconstruction baton and advances A004
into the exact-run current-Q7 retirement/final-visible-handoff seam. P4 now
places P3/P4 presentation source directly in the canonical PS2 compile and
linked reproducibility manifests. Revision 0027 deliberately separates
retirement from absolute scheduler/drop work so a later runtime cannot acquire
a decoder-to-compositor path before a bounded safe visible retirement mechanism
exists.

Revision 0026 independently accepts the completed
`A004-PRESENTATION-OWNERSHIP-FIRST-FRAME-R3` Reconstruction baton and advances
A004 into the single physical compositor / first synchronized MPEG presentation
/ shared-media-clock arm seam. It also accepts the worker's bounded dictionary
maintenance repair after independently confirming that the final change merely
adds Display to the known-safe reconciliation set and restores specialized
Diagnostics metadata exactly.

Revision 0025 independently accepts the completed
`A004-RFB-FREEZE-REFRESH-R2` Reconstruction baton and advances A004 into the
presentation-owned start/WAIT_FIRST_FRAME/first-frame ownership seam. The next
packet deliberately does not restore H1's direct active-stop behavior because
current Q7 requires retirement to remain a later ordered transition.

Revision 0024 is an execution-policy correction only. It adopts Reconstruction
Contract revision 0006, applies autonomous repository execution to the currently
active A004 P2 packet, and leaves that packet's engineering scope, required
behavior, C1-C9 acceptance criteria, invariants, non-goals, dependency ordering,
and worker role unchanged.

Revision 0023 independently accepts the completed
`A004-MPEG-CALIBRATION-CORE-R1` Reconstruction baton and advances A004 into
the next bounded owner seam: generic RFB freeze/request/full-refresh policy at
the already-proven RFB safe scheduling boundary.

## A004 P1 Foreman acceptance

Live pickup authority was independently refreshed as:

- branch HEAD `b566b500c832d9d98bdb2bd4a5ccce7dbd6f05fe`;
- final pre-log source/dictionary authority
  `094f07fff17801152bcd0d17ac69c570d8bfad27`;
- immutable Reconstruction log
  `docs/ledge/work-log/20260920T171848-0400__reconstruction__a004-presentation__interactive.md`.

The worker landed five commits after Foreman base `672f67eb...`:

- `ad00a7a07c15c8d56f89e5ac664e07507e50c312` —
  `feat(ui): add MPEG calibration core`;
- `51025be8553c3dad8b5a11002fb57f9bb7a5af62` —
  `docs(symbols): index MPEG calibration core`;
- `3d9f4a821f16d51a3d22597b4a539009aac7705f` —
  `refactor(ui): name MPEG calibration action enum`;
- `094f07fff17801152bcd0d17ac69c570d8bfad27` —
  `docs(symbols): bind calibration actions to named enum`;
- `b566b500c832d9d98bdb2bd4a5ccce7dbd6f05fe` —
  the required immutable Reconstruction work log.

Independent source review confirms:

- MPEG CALIBRATION is separate from DESKTOP CALIBRATION;
- `src/ui/mpeg_calibration.{c,h}` owns only local calibration value/state;
- base, inner-content/matte, and outer/suppression meanings remain distinct;
- width/height are bounded and 16-pixel aligned while x/y remain pixel precise;
- geometry calculations use widened arithmetic before bounded int32 storage;
- REVIEW accept remains unarmed while X/accept is held and requires release
  followed by a fresh press;
- successful acceptance copies one immutable caller-visible region and does not
  imply START, producer admission, decode, first presentation, clock arm, or
  MPEG visual ownership;
- cancel publishes no false accepted region and exit remains quarantined until
  all calibration actions are released;
- no RFB, Transport, MPEG decoder, Display, Pi, GS, or Application dependency
  was imported into the calibration owner;
- no new top-level source directory was created.

A004-P1-C1 through A004-P1-C9 are accepted as MET within the packet's bounded
source scope.

## Independent P1 evidence

GitHub Actions run `35539055477` at pickup HEAD
`b566b500c832d9d98bdb2bd4a5ccce7dbd6f05fe` completed SUCCESS.

Observed jobs:

- host-unit — PASS;
- project-check — PASS;
- dictionary-long — PASS;
- ps2-compile — PASS;
- ps2-link/current-source reproducibility — PASS;
- dictionary-reconcile — SKIPPED as expected after already-coherent dictionaries.

These are machine/repository checks. They do not constitute physical PS2
qualification.

No physical hardware run was performed for A004 P1.

## Forward-authority correction for A004

`docs/ledge/LEDGE_AUDIT_A004_PRESENTATION_CALIBRATION.md` revision 0001 is a
2026-09-15 temporal audit tranche and remains historically truthful. It must not
be destructively rewritten merely because later architecture work refined
retirement semantics.

For forward reconstruction, Q7 in
`docs/ledge/LEDGE_WIRE_RUNTIME_DECISIONS.md` revision 0011 is governing
where it conflicts with the older audit's retirement wording.

Current Q7 requires:

1. MPEG retirement first closes new MPEG production/admission;
2. already accepted MPEG may drain;
3. RFB suppression may then be released so RFB can request, receive and rebuild
   the underlying desktop while valid retiring MPEG/mattes remain visible;
4. final safe MPEG retirement removes MPEG/mattes and reveals the already
   refreshing RFB desktop.

Therefore **active or retiring MPEG is not equivalent to a global RFB freeze**.
The global freeze reconstructed by P2 is for ownership gaps such as calibration
foreground and WAIT_FIRST_FRAME-style protection. Later presentation ownership
will use region-local suppression/composition while RFB framebuffer truth may
continue to advance.

## Why P2 is RFB flow protection before presentation ownership

Current clean RFB already owns:

- exact request serialization through
  `pstvnc_rfb_session_request_update()`;
- complete server-message parsing;
- a nonblocking live service boundary that returns IDLE only before consuming
  any byte of the next server message;
- parser-safe finite-session quiesce at that same complete-message boundary.

Current Application still drives a simple one-request/one-response cadence and
has no MPEG lifecycle.

Frozen H1 evidence separately recovered:

- a calibration RFB gate that blocks new requests and remote presentation while
  frozen without destroying the RFB/PSTV session;
- one outstanding framebuffer request at a time;
- an in-flight pre-freeze response still completing protocol ownership while
  visual publication remains suppressed;
- one coalesced FULL/nonincremental request after thaw before normal
  incremental cadence resumes.

Those facts form a small RFB-owned policy seam that can be reconstructed before
the later presentation owner exists. This avoids putting MPEG/calibration types
inside RFB and avoids inventing temporary Application callbacks.

## A004 P2 Foreman acceptance

Live pickup authority was independently refreshed as:

- branch HEAD `773cdd905cde5a0c38a1e732c10d4d5f2d123c46`;
- final pre-log source/dictionary authority
  `5aa84f1dc0e3017b88214e20637ab1a0605cc38a`;
- immutable Reconstruction log
  `docs/ledge/work-log/20260920T175245-0400__reconstruction__a004-presentation__interactive.md`.

The worker landed five commits after Foreman authority `aaa452899...`:

- `7e779fdb113ee37dfda1e60f4887c7d7c608037a` —
  generic RFB freeze/refresh flow policy plus focused host contract;
- `7600d77f158892d1b850c686371cb3c9e72d67b1` —
  tree-identical deterministic dictionary-reconciliation trigger;
- `a64b6427356ff1c2fcbc87f2e40cd126048b7589` —
  automated clean-symbol reconciliation;
- `5aa84f1dc0e3017b88214e20637ab1a0605cc38a` —
  RFB domain responsibility prose;
- `773cdd905cde5a0c38a1e732c10d4d5f2d123c46` —
  required immutable Reconstruction work log.

Independent source review confirms:

- `src/rfb/flow_policy.{c,h}` contains only generic RFB live-flow facts:
  global frozen/thawed state, one outstanding request, one pending FULL debt,
  request choice and publication permission;
- no MPEG, calibration, decoder, producer, GS, presentation-owner, Transport
  lifecycle or Application type/header is imported;
- `next_request()` is non-mutating, so merely inspecting policy cannot consume
  FULL debt;
- FULL debt is cleared only after the currently owed FULL request is recorded as
  successfully sent;
- freeze while one request is outstanding does not discard protocol ownership;
  the response may complete at the existing RFB complete-message boundary and
  clear that outstanding fact while visual publication remains blocked;
- repeated freeze/thaw intent before recovery advances coalesces, while a later
  genuine interval after recovery send creates distinct debt;
- existing strict initial-frame authority and parser/session source remain
  unchanged;
- current Q7 remains possible because active/retiring MPEG is not represented
  inside the global RFB freeze policy.

A004-P2-C1 through A004-P2-C9 are accepted as MET within the packet's bounded
source scope.

GitHub Actions run `35540415181` at pickup HEAD completed SUCCESS.
Host evidence includes both `RFB_FLOW_POLICY_TEST=PASS` and
`transport_runtime_test: PASS`; project-check, strict dictionary, PS2 compile
and PS2 link/current-source reproducibility also passed.

The earlier behavior-head run retained another occurrence of the already-seen
timing-sensitive `transport_runtime_test` assertions at lines 787/789. No
Transport source changed in P2, the starting authority was green, later runs
passed unchanged source, and the final coherent head is green. This remains
test/infrastructure debt rather than an A004 P2 product defect.

No physical PS2 run was performed and P2 is not yet wired into product
Application runtime. Those facts remain explicit evidence boundaries.

## Why P3 is presentation ownership state before compositor/runtime wiring

Current clean authority now has:

- P1: one accepted immutable MPEG CALIBRATION region value;
- P2: one generic RFB freeze/request/full-refresh policy;
- A003: MPEG decoder ownership plus the settled rule that Presentation owns the
  first-real-presentation media-clock arm boundary;
- Platform: one existing PS2 graphics path whose synchronized flip is already
  the application-visible physical completion boundary.

Frozen H1 `h1_mpeg_presentation_owner` and `h1_mpeg_start_handoff` recover a
useful start-side ownership model: RFB_ONLY -> WAIT_FIRST_FRAME -> MPEG_OWNED,
with immutable region/suppression facts and stale-generation rejection.

Two H1 details must not be copied literally:

1. H1 minted presentation generations internally; current architecture treats
   MPEG run/generation identity as caller-owned exact-run authority. Presentation
   consumes that identity and must not create a competing generation namespace.
2. H1's active `stop()` returned directly from MPEG_OWNED to RFB_ONLY. Current
   Q7 supersedes that behavior: active MPEG retirement requires a later ordered
   retirement phase where RFB may rebuild underneath still-visible retiring
   MPEG before final reveal.

P3 therefore reconstructs only the start-side visible-ownership contract and
reserves actual physical composition/clock-arm and Q7 retirement for later
tranches.

## A004 P3 Foreman acceptance

Live pickup authority was independently refreshed as:

- branch HEAD `309a87851c17f65600ee1d647022cb8b6276baab`;
- final pre-log source/tooling authority
  `b8abd1a89f39710d99691e89e7e24ef0dcc75509`;
- immutable Reconstruction log
  `docs/ledge/work-log/20260920T181426-0400__reconstruction__a004-presentation__interactive.md`.

The worker landed seven commits after Foreman authority `2f16a2b9...`:

- `abe684c79cf49f856d3d72b3fe5523a815a4034b` —
  Display-owned MPEG visible-ownership core and host fixture;
- `d4035cce00d4bbef297b2018c1839767fdc2beed` —
  first tree-identical dictionary reconciliation trigger;
- `bfd2d0ffc54ef7100ea64b1fea65716a4bf04560` —
  temporary reconciliation-tool generalization after Display was found absent;
- `e6ebb4adf2280936f511612999a8793cd296c28b` —
  second tree-identical reconciliation trigger;
- `aa367034fa874d854209836e3133f45de5f68caa` —
  automated symbol reconciliation;
- `b8abd1a89f39710d99691e89e7e24ef0dcc75509` —
  bounded tooling correction preserving unsupported dictionary metadata;
- `309a87851c17f65600ee1d647022cb8b6276baab` —
  required immutable Reconstruction work log.

Independent source review confirms:

- `src/display/mpeg_presentation.{c,h}` is a pure Display/Presentation owner;
- it uses no UI/calibration, RFB, Transport, MPEG-decoder, Platform or
  media-clock API;
- one caller-supplied nonzero MPEG run/generation is copied verbatim and never
  minted or incremented by Presentation;
- one already-resolved `base / inner_content / suppression` geometry snapshot
  is copied immutably for the run;
- base geometry remains macroblock-sized while inner content is a symmetric
  presentation-local inset and suppression must contain the complete base;
- RFB_ONLY -> WAIT_FIRST_FRAME is the only arm transition;
- WAIT_FIRST_FRAME reports FROZEN_RFB_DESKTOP/global protection while explicitly
  not claiming MPEG visual ownership;
- only an exact-generation first-frame-presented event may promote to
  MPEG_OWNED, and duplicate/stale/wrong events fail closed;
- MPEG_OWNED reports COMPOSITED, releases the generic global-freeze requirement,
  and retains the exact generation/suppression snapshot;
- exact pending-start abort returns to RFB_ONLY without creating RFB
  FULL-refresh debt;
- there is deliberately no active-stop/retire API, so current-Q7 retirement
  remains attachable without an H1-style early reveal;
- the first-frame state transition itself performs no physical draw, upload,
  flip or media-clock arm and therefore does not manufacture hardware evidence.

A004-P3-C1 through A004-P3-C10 are accepted as MET within the packet's bounded
source scope.

### P3 dictionary/tooling repair acceptance

The worker's first behavior commit exposed a genuine integration defect: the
canonical deterministic reconciliation helper did not target `src/display`.

The temporary broad reconciliation then removed two maintained Diagnostics rows
for live GNU `__typeof__(sendto)` alias declarations. The worker correctly
rejected that collateral removal and narrowed the helper again.

Independent Foreman comparison confirms the final state:

- `src/diagnostics/SYMBOLS.md` is byte-identical to Foreman base
  (blob `5918063c0a27596ab558aa6160ec69856dd43e5c`);
- the generated portal again reports Diagnostics=69;
- Display now has complete coverage with 113 symbols;
- relative to the prior helper, the only functional target-set change is adding
  `Path("src/display")`;
- the workflow change only stages `src/display/SYMBOLS.md` during authorized
  reconciliation;
- specialized Diagnostics/framebuffer/UI dictionaries are not newly rewritten
  by the helper.

That final tooling repair is accepted as bounded integration work rather than
product behavior.

### P3 evidence

GitHub Actions run `35541637912` at pickup HEAD completed SUCCESS.

Host logs explicitly show:

- `MPEG_PRESENTATION_TEST=PASS`;
- `RFB_FLOW_POLICY_TEST=PASS`;
- `MPEG_CALIBRATION_UNIT=PASS`;
- `transport_runtime_test: PASS`;
- the remaining canonical host suite passing.

Project check, strict dictionary audit, broad PS2 compile, and linked
current-source reproducibility also passed.

Evidence limitation remains important: the current PS2 compile/link source
lists do not yet include the still-unwired new P3 translation unit. Those jobs
prove the existing linked product was not broken; the direct executable P3
evidence is the host fixture. No physical PS2 run was performed.

## Why P4 is the single physical compositor / first-sync seam

Current authority now has:

- P1 immutable accepted MPEG calibration meaning;
- P2 generic RFB freeze/request/full-refresh policy;
- P3 exact-run Presentation ownership state;
- A003 MPEG decoder ownership and safe-stop behavior;
- A002 one session-scoped shared media clock;
- one existing PS2 Platform graphics owner whose successful
  `pstvnc_ps2_graphics_present()` returns only after `gsKit_sync_flip()`.

Frozen H1 `h1_cumulative39_graphics` proves the required visible layering:

```text
remote desktop
-> black outer suppression footprint
-> MPEG base
-> black symmetric inner matte
-> local UI / OSK overlay
-> one GS queue / synchronized flip
```

H1 also proves that MPEG picture memory arrives in RGB16 macroblock order and
must be presented through the same physical GS owner. Its useful resource
behavior caches desktop/overlay state, reuses bounded video texture resources,
and returns video-present success only after synchronized physical presentation.

The clean reconstruction must **not** copy H1's structural shortcuts:

- no textual inclusion/wrapping of another `.c` graphics owner;
- no second GS presenter;
- no semaphore justified solely by competing graphics callers;
- no direct active `clear_video()` product stop that bypasses current Q7;
- no MPEG decoder worker directly taking GS ownership.

Current clean MPEG decode also exposes a real dependency for later integration:
the decoder owns its picture buffer but has no per-picture presentation handoff.
P4 therefore reconstructs the physical compositor contract and first-sync
semantics without yet wiring the MPEG worker or final Application transaction.

A003/A004 authority requires the shared media epoch to be armed by Presentation
at the first **real synchronized MPEG presentation boundary**, not at START,
producer admission, decode completion, upload, or a source-level state change.
P4 must make that boundary explicit and host-testable while preserving that only
a PS2 run can qualify the physical result.

## A004 P4 Foreman acceptance

Live pickup authority was independently refreshed as:

- branch HEAD `a88718833fb15a8c6fdba668daea9c9b78c960d9`;
- final pre-log source/dictionary/build authority
  `37bbd71ca5afaf3dfb63568e85f9d31dbf043d08`;
- immutable Reconstruction log
  `docs/ledge/work-log/20260920T184357-0400__reconstruction__a004-presentation__interactive.md`.

A role-error NOOP log exists immediately before the Reconstruction range at
`2f234d140213ed79d37c6bc2c228f12dfae90fdf`. It changed no Foreman state,
packet, product source or planning authority. The immutable log contract requires
that historical record to remain preserved; it is not current Foreman authority.

The actual P4 Reconstruction range is:

- `75d5c87cd47a3d8b7108d790eed890de4bbaf7b9` —
  synchronized MPEG compositor/frame/Platform mechanism and direct build wiring;
- `bbf7e52f45ec577ccd9eeea688cd4023d87d075f` —
  restore executable mode on the strict PS2 compile script after a Git-write
  mode regression;
- `25081e22864db4f09c67c10dd7c4662cfa975f50` —
  deterministic dictionary-reconciliation trigger;
- `8f147edc97219df4b59c5118566a377f0a0bd0ab` —
  generated current clean dictionaries;
- `f0e1da106035063c63555f93d2b480c36306128c` —
  synchronized compositor ownership prose;
- `37bbd71ca5afaf3dfb63568e85f9d31dbf043d08` —
  preserve legal full-inner-matte geometry where resolved inner content may be
  zero-sized;
- `a88718833fb15a8c6fdba668daea9c9b78c960d9` —
  required immutable Reconstruction work log.

Independent source review confirms:

- `src/display/mpeg_frame.{c,h}` defines one decoder-independent
  caller-owned RGB16 16x16-macroblock surface and bounded deterministic detile;
- `src/display/mpeg_compositor.{c,h}` owns exact-run coordination but contains
  no gsKit/dmaKit, decoder, Transport, RFB or calibration call;
- `src/platform/ps2_graphics.{c,h}` remains the sole current GS/dmaKit owner;
- no second presenter, graphics semaphore or H1 C-file wrapper was introduced;
- P4 reuses one maximum-size MPEG VRAM allocation and one bounded aligned EE
  detile buffer rather than allocating permanent frame/run resources;
- the one render body orders desktop -> suppression -> MPEG -> inner matte ->
  local overlay -> queue -> synchronized flip;
- ordinary desktop/local-overlay refresh while MPEG remains retained redraws the
  same composite, so authoritative RFB truth can advance underneath the visible
  suppression footprint;
- the Platform synchronized result is populated only after
  `gsKit_sync_flip()`, with `GetTimerSystemTime()` sampled after that
  boundary in `kBUSCLK` ticks;
- Display rejects stale generation or source/base geometry mismatch before the
  Platform presenter is called;
- WAIT_FIRST_FRAME can arm an unarmed session media clock only from that
  post-sync timer observation and only then performs exact P3 promotion;
- a pre-existing session media epoch is preserved across a later MPEG run;
- MPEG_OWNED frames neither re-arm the epoch nor duplicate P3 promotion;
- failures after physical synchronization preserve truthful effects while
  returning failure rather than claiming a completed first-presentation
  transaction;
- no active clear/stop API exists in P4, preserving current-Q7 attachment;
- the final inner-matte correction correctly permits an accepted P1/P3 geometry
  whose inner content is zero width/height while keeping base/suppression
  positive and bounded.

A004-P4-C1 through A004-P4-C12 are accepted as MET within the bounded source and
machine-evidence scope.

### P4 evidence

Pickup-head GitHub Actions run `35543110959` completed SUCCESS.

Host evidence includes:

- `MPEG_COMPOSITOR_TEST=PASS`;
- `MPEG_PRESENTATION_TEST=PASS`;
- `RFB_FLOW_POLICY_TEST=PASS`;
- `MPEG_CALIBRATION_UNIT=PASS`;
- `transport_runtime_test: PASS`.

Canonical direct PS2 compile explicitly compiled:

- `src/display/mpeg_frame.c`;
- `src/display/mpeg_presentation.c`;
- `src/display/mpeg_compositor.c`;
- `src/platform/ps2_graphics.c`;

and reported `CLEAN_PS2_COMPILE_CHECK=PASS`.

The linked clean build explicitly compiled/linked
`mpeg_frame.o`, `mpeg_presentation.o`, `mpeg_compositor.o` and
`ps2_graphics.o` into both reproducibility builds and reported
`LEDGE_CURRENT_LINKED_REPRODUCIBILITY=PASS`.

Project check and strict dictionary audit also passed. No physical PS2/television
run occurred; visible layering, actual first-frame timing, A/V sync and endurance
remain hardware debt.

## Why P5 is retirement before scheduler/runtime wiring

P4 can now safely establish and retain an exact MPEG visual owner, while
ordinary desktop updates continue beneath the retained suppression layer.
However, current source intentionally has no bounded exact-run transition that
can retire that visual owner and reveal the rebuilt RFB desktop.

Current Q7 requires a real ordered retirement:

1. Application closes new MPEG production/admission;
2. already accepted MPEG may drain;
3. RFB refresh can proceed underneath still-visible MPEG/mattes;
4. only after the decoder/runtime reaches its safe stop boundary and the caller
   has sufficient underlay-restoration evidence may the final synchronized
   visible handoff remove MPEG/mattes and reveal RFB.

The production/Transport/decoder/RFB proofs are cross-domain Application facts.
Presentation must not invent them. What is missing now is the narrow
Presentation/Platform mechanism that can represent RETIRING, continue exact-run
drain presentation, seal further frame presentation before final reveal, and
perform one fail-closed synchronized reveal through the existing GS owner.

That retirement seam is a dependency for later decoder-worker handoff. Wiring
the decoder into P4 first would create a runtime that can start/retain MPEG but
has no bounded owner-correct visible retirement path.

Absolute scheduler/drop is also required A004 behavior, but it is independent
timing policy and remains the next later tranche rather than being bundled into
retirement.

ASSIGNING_BASE_HEAD=`REFRESH_CURRENT_LEDGE_HEAD_AT_WAKE`

### Objective

Reconstruct the clean **current-Q7 exact-run presentation retirement and final
visible handoff seam**.

The bounded target is the presentation-side sequence:

`MPEG_OWNED -> RETIRING -> REVEAL_PENDING -> RFB_ONLY`

while preserving the exact active run snapshot and visible MPEG/mattes until the
one synchronized final reveal actually succeeds.

P5 supplies the Presentation/Platform mechanism that a later Application
transaction will invoke after it has independently proven producer/Transport,
decoder-safe-stop and RFB-underlay prerequisites. P5 must not pretend to prove
those external facts itself.

### Execution policy

This is ordinary autonomous Reconstruction work through repository/GitHub
authority and canonical CI.

No physical PS2 or live-Pi action is required for this packet. Do not request
user terminal proxy work.

### Required authority / forensic trace

Read current at wake, including:

- Reconstruction Contract rev 0006;
- Foreman State rev 0027;
- Wire runtime decisions rev 0011, especially current Q7/Q8/Q9;
- A003 MPEG-generation audit rev 0001, especially safe decoder-stop and residual
  isolation;
- A004 presentation/calibration audit rev 0001 as temporal evidence, with
  current Q7 governing where retirement wording conflicts;
- clean architecture and architecture overlay;
- current `src/display/mpeg_presentation.{c,h}`;
- current `src/display/mpeg_compositor.{c,h}`;
- current `src/platform/ps2_graphics.{c,h}`;
- current `src/rfb/flow_policy.{c,h}`;
- current `src/mpeg/decoder.{c,h}`;
- canonical host and PS2 build manifests.

Trace frozen H1 and later qualified retirement evidence only far enough to
recover safe visible-retirement mechanics, including relevant:

- `h1_cumulative39_graphics.{c,h}`;
- `CP2P_MPEG_SAFE_STOP_LIFECYCLE.md`;
- mature CP2P retirement/start-stop evidence;
- historical direct `clear_video()` only as a mechanism to replace, not product
  authority.

### Required behavior

1. **Presentation owns visible retirement state.** Extend the P3 owner with
   explicit retirement phases equivalent to RETIRING and REVEAL_PENDING.
   Do not put run lifecycle meaning in Platform, RFB, Transport or decoder.
2. **Exact-run begin-retirement fence.** Only the exact nonzero currently
   MPEG_OWNED generation may enter RETIRING. Wrong/stale/duplicate requests fail
   closed without replacing or clearing the live snapshot.
3. **Retiring remains visually MPEG-owned.** RETIRING retains the exact geometry
   and suppression snapshot, reports COMPOSITED/visual MPEG ownership, requires
   no global P2 RFB freeze, and does not reveal RFB.
4. **Accepted-frame drain remains possible.** The P4 compositor may continue to
   present exact-generation frames while RETIRING so already accepted data can
   drain. Stale/other-generation frames remain rejected. No new run may arm.
5. **Underlying RFB remains able to advance.** Ordinary desktop presentation
   updates during RETIRING must continue refreshing the cached RFB desktop
   underneath still-visible MPEG/mattes exactly as P4 permits.
6. **Seal before reveal.** Provide an exact-generation transition from RETIRING
   to a REVEAL_PENDING-equivalent state that fences any further MPEG frame
   presentation while retaining the exact run snapshot and visible retained
   composite.
7. **External retirement proofs stay external.** Entering RETIRING or
   REVEAL_PENDING must not claim that Pi production is closed, decoder worker is
   joined, residual Transport bytes are discarded, or RFB underlay is current.
   Those are later Application orchestration obligations.
8. **One GS owner performs final reveal.** Add the smallest Platform mechanism
   needed to present the cached desktop plus current local overlay without the
   retained MPEG/suppression/matte layers, through the existing single render
   owner and one synchronized flip.
9. **Fail-closed physical reveal.** Platform must not permanently discard the
   retained MPEG resource/visibility facts merely because reveal was requested.
   Commit the retained-video removal only after the synchronized no-video frame
   succeeds; failure must leave a retryable/containable retained presentation
   state rather than silently exposing stale RFB.
10. **Commit logical RFB_ONLY only after physical success.** The Display
    retirement coordinator may clear the P3 run snapshot and return to RFB_ONLY
    only after exact REVEAL_PENDING state and successful synchronized final
    reveal. Before then, snapshot/suppression remain authoritative.
11. **No media-clock rewrite.** Retirement does not re-arm, replace or clear the
    session media epoch. Session-clock lifetime remains outside per-run visible
    retirement.
12. **No RFB refresh-debt duplication.** P5 does not create, consume or fake P2
    FULL-refresh debt and does not call RFB APIs. Later Application orchestration
    decides which RFB request/restoration evidence satisfies current Q7.
13. **Local overlay remains final.** The final no-MPEG synchronized reveal still
    presents the current local UI/OSK overlay above the cached desktop.
14. **No H1 direct-stop shortcut.** Do not add a public path that lets ordinary
    MPEG_OWNED state jump directly to RFB_ONLY or calls a generic
    `clear_video()` merely because stop was requested.
15. **No premature runtime wiring.** Do not wire decoder worker callbacks/queues,
    Transport START/RETIRE, Pi producer control, P2 runtime flow, calibration
    flow, scheduler/drop, or final Application orchestration in this packet.
16. **Direct build/test coverage.** Extend focused host contracts for retirement
    state/final-reveal ordering and preserve direct canonical PS2 compile/link
    coverage for every modified presentation/Platform translation unit.

### Placement / shape guidance

Keep lifecycle-visible state and exact generation fencing in
`src/display/mpeg_presentation.{c,h}`.

Keep cross-owner synchronized retirement coordination in the existing Display
presentation/compositor responsibility family.

Keep raw GS/dmaKit retained-video removal in
`src/platform/ps2_graphics.{c,h}`; Platform receives no generation and learns
no producer/decoder/RFB lifecycle meaning.

A two-phase logical retirement is preferred over a one-call stop because it
makes the drain fence and final visible reveal independently inspectable.

### Acceptance criteria

- `A004-P5-C1 RETIRING_STATE`: exact active generation alone can enter a
  distinct retiring state that retains visual MPEG ownership/snapshot.
- `A004-P5-C2 DRAIN_FENCE`: exact retiring frames may still present until an
  explicit seal; stale/new-run frames cannot.
- `A004-P5-C3 UNDERLAY_OVERLAP`: desktop updates can continue underneath
  retained retiring MPEG without revealing the suppression footprint.
- `A004-P5-C4 REVEAL_PENDING`: sealing retirement blocks further MPEG frames
  while retaining exact snapshot and visible MPEG until physical handoff.
- `A004-P5-C5 EXTERNAL_PROOF_BOUNDARY`: Presentation does not manufacture
  producer-close, decoder-safe-stop, residual-discard or RFB-current evidence.
- `A004-P5-C6 SINGLE_GS_REVEAL`: final no-video reveal uses the existing sole
  Platform GS owner and one synchronized presentation.
- `A004-P5-C7 FAIL_CLOSED_REVEAL`: failed reveal does not commit retained-video
  removal or logical RFB_ONLY.
- `A004-P5-C8 FINAL_COMMIT`: only successful exact pending reveal clears the
  run snapshot and returns Presentation to RFB_ONLY.
- `A004-P5-C9 CLOCK_STABILITY`: retirement neither re-arms nor clears the
  session media epoch.
- `A004-P5-C10 RFB_POLICY_BOUNDARY`: no RFB/P2 debt or request mechanics are
  duplicated inside Presentation/Platform.
- `A004-P5-C11 Q7_COMPATIBILITY`: source shape supports close -> drain ->
  underlay refresh overlap -> safe synchronized reveal without H1 direct-stop.
- `A004-P5-C12 CLEAN_EVIDENCE`: focused/full host tests, project/dictionary
  checks, direct PS2 compile and linked reproducibility all pass for exact final
  source; physical qualification remains separate.

### Explicit non-goals

Do not implement in P5:

- absolute video scheduler or lateness/drop;
- decoder-worker -> compositor frame queue/handoff;
- Pi producer close/RETIRE transaction;
- Transport residual discard/credit finalization;
- P2/RFB request orchestration;
- calibration input/runtime wiring;
- final A003/A004 Application transaction;
- Wire-loss restoration policy;
- physical PS2/television qualification.

### Worker return

Return:

- exact current/frozen retirement evidence inspected;
- exact source/test/build/dictionary commits changed;
- retirement-state and generation-fence shape;
- whether exact retiring frames remain presentable before seal;
- final no-video synchronized reveal mechanism and fail-closed ordering;
- explicit external-proof boundary for producer/decoder/RFB facts;
- confirmation session media clock is untouched by retirement;
- A004-P5-C1 through C12 disposition;
- focused/full/direct-PS2 evidence;
- explicit confirmation no MPEG_OWNED -> RFB_ONLY direct-stop shortcut exists;
- evidence gaps/hardware non-claims;
- exact next dependency/baton point.

Emit exactly one immutable Reconstruction log using:

- ROLE_KEY=`reconstruction`
- WORK_ITEM_KEY=`a004-presentation`
- WORKER_KEY=`interactive`

Do not begin scheduler/drop, decoder-worker handoff or final Application
orchestration in the same shift.

## Deferred dependency graph

Expected remaining A004 work after active P5 is:

1. absolute common-clock video scheduler/drop policy as its own deterministic
   presentation-timing tranche;
2. explicit decoded-frame handoff/runtime integration from the MPEG worker to
   the sole Presentation owner, consuming the scheduler and P5 retirement seams;
3. final Application orchestration consuming A003 plus P1/P2/P3/P4/P5 public
   seams, including activation, P2 protection/thaw, producer/decoder lifecycle,
   current-Q7 retirement/restoration, failure containment and shutdown ordering.

Foreman must choose the exact next seam from returned P5 source rather than
pre-authorizing later implementation.

This is planning only, not worker authority to pre-implement later work.

## Hardware qualification debt

HARDWARE_PENDING=A004 visual geometry/matte/suppression/first-frame qualification; MPEG one-run/repeated-run stale fencing and Wire-loss behavior; current-Q7 overlapped RFB restoration; R1 product runtime where later required; final product Q4 establishment; exact product Wire service/runtime; all-guns endurance; exact product ELF; native Pi RFB reproducibility/lifecycle qualification

## Foreman next pickup

Consume the `A004-Q7-RETIREMENT-VISIBLE-HANDOFF-R5` Reconstruction baton,
independently verify exact-run retirement/drain/seal/final-reveal ordering,
fail-closed retained-video removal through the sole GS owner, preservation of
external producer/decoder/RFB proof boundaries, and direct PS2 build coverage.
Then choose the next bounded absolute scheduler/drop seam from actual source.

Do not execute the packet from the Foreman seat.

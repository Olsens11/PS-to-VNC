Revision 0028 independently accepts the completed
`A004-Q7-RETIREMENT-VISIBLE-HANDOFF-R5` Reconstruction baton and advances A004
into the absolute common-clock video scheduler / presentation-drop policy seam.
R5 now provides exact-run RETIRING and REVEAL_PENDING phases plus a fail-closed
single-GS synchronized final reveal, while leaving producer-close,
decoder-safe-stop, Transport residual-finalization and RFB-restoration proof as
external Application obligations.

Revision 0027 independently accepts the completed
`A004-SHARED-COMPOSITOR-FIRST-SYNC-R4` Reconstruction baton and advances A004
into the exact-run current-Q7 retirement/final-visible-handoff seam. P4 now
places P3/P4 presentation source directly in the canonical PS2 compile and
linked reproducibility manifests. Revision 0027 deliberately separates
retirement from absolute scheduler/drop work so a later runtime cannot acquire
a decoder-to-compositor path before a bounded safe visible retirement mechanism
exists.

Revision 0026 independently accepts the completed
`A004-PRESENTATION-OWNERSHIP-FIRST-FRAME-R3` Reconstruction baton and advances
A004 into the single physical compositor / first synchronized MPEG presentation
/ shared-media-clock arm seam. It also accepts the worker's bounded dictionary
maintenance repair after independently confirming that the final change merely
adds Display to the known-safe reconciliation set and restores specialized
Diagnostics metadata exactly.

Revision 0025 independently accepts the completed
`A004-RFB-FREEZE-REFRESH-R2` Reconstruction baton and advances A004 into the
presentation-owned start/WAIT_FIRST_FRAME/first-frame ownership seam. The next
packet deliberately does not restore H1's direct active-stop behavior because
current Q7 requires retirement to remain a later ordered transition.

Revision 0024 is an execution-policy correction only. It adopts Reconstruction
Contract revision 0006, applies autonomous repository execution to the currently
active A004 P2 packet, and leaves that packet's engineering scope, required
behavior, C1-C9 acceptance criteria, invariants, non-goals, dependency ordering,
and worker role unchanged.

Revision 0023 independently accepts the completed
`A004-MPEG-CALIBRATION-CORE-R1` Reconstruction baton and advances A004 into
the next bounded owner seam: generic RFB freeze/request/full-refresh policy at
the already-proven RFB safe scheduling boundary.

## A004 P1 Foreman acceptance

Live pickup authority was independently refreshed as:

- branch HEAD `b566b500c832d9d98bdb2bd4a5ccce7dbd6f05fe`;
- final pre-log source/dictionary authority
  `094f07fff17801152bcd0d17ac69c570d8bfad27`;
- immutable Reconstruction log
  `docs/ledge/work-log/20260920T171848-0400__reconstruction__a004-presentation__interactive.md`.

The worker landed five commits after Foreman base `672f67eb...`:

- `ad00a7a07c15c8d56f89e5ac664e07507e50c312` —
  `feat(ui): add MPEG calibration core`;
- `51025be8553c3dad8b5a11002fb57f9bb7a5af62` —
  `docs(symbols): index MPEG calibration core`;
- `3d9f4a821f16d51a3d22597b4a539009aac7705f` —
  `refactor(ui): name MPEG calibration action enum`;
- `094f07fff17801152bcd0d17ac69c570d8bfad27` —
  `docs(symbols): bind calibration actions to named enum`;
- `b566b500c832d9d98bdb2bd4a5ccce7dbd6f05fe` —
  the required immutable Reconstruction work log.

Independent source review confirms:

- MPEG CALIBRATION is separate from DESKTOP CALIBRATION;
- `src/ui/mpeg_calibration.{c,h}` owns only local calibration value/state;
- base, inner-content/matte, and outer/suppression meanings remain distinct;
- width/height are bounded and 16-pixel aligned while x/y remain pixel precise;
- geometry calculations use widened arithmetic before bounded int32 storage;
- REVIEW accept remains unarmed while X/accept is held and requires release
  followed by a fresh press;
- successful acceptance copies one immutable caller-visible region and does not
  imply START, producer admission, decode, first presentation, clock arm, or
  MPEG visual ownership;
- cancel publishes no false accepted region and exit remains quarantined until
  all calibration actions are released;
- no RFB, Transport, MPEG decoder, Display, Pi, GS, or Application dependency
  was imported into the calibration owner;
- no new top-level source directory was created.

A004-P1-C1 through A004-P1-C9 are accepted as MET within the packet's bounded
source scope.

## Independent P1 evidence

GitHub Actions run `35539055477` at pickup HEAD
`b566b500c832d9d98bdb2bd4a5ccce7dbd6f05fe` completed SUCCESS.

Observed jobs:

- host-unit — PASS;
- project-check — PASS;
- dictionary-long — PASS;
- ps2-compile — PASS;
- ps2-link/current-source reproducibility — PASS;
- dictionary-reconcile — SKIPPED as expected after already-coherent dictionaries.

These are machine/repository checks. They do not constitute physical PS2
qualification.

No physical hardware run was performed for A004 P1.

## Forward-authority correction for A004

`docs/ledge/LEDGE_AUDIT_A004_PRESENTATION_CALIBRATION.md` revision 0001 is a
2026-09-15 temporal audit tranche and remains historically truthful. It must not
be destructively rewritten merely because later architecture work refined
retirement semantics.

For forward reconstruction, Q7 in
`docs/ledge/LEDGE_WIRE_RUNTIME_DECISIONS.md` revision 0011 is governing
where it conflicts with the older audit's retirement wording.

Current Q7 requires:

1. MPEG retirement first closes new MPEG production/admission;
2. already accepted MPEG may drain;
3. RFB suppression may then be released so RFB can request, receive and rebuild
   the underlying desktop while valid retiring MPEG/mattes remain visible;
4. final safe MPEG retirement removes MPEG/mattes and reveals the already
   refreshing RFB desktop.

Therefore **active or retiring MPEG is not equivalent to a global RFB freeze**.
The global freeze reconstructed by P2 is for ownership gaps such as calibration
foreground and WAIT_FIRST_FRAME-style protection. Later presentation ownership
will use region-local suppression/composition while RFB framebuffer truth may
continue to advance.

## Why P2 is RFB flow protection before presentation ownership

Current clean RFB already owns:

- exact request serialization through
  `pstvnc_rfb_session_request_update()`;
- complete server-message parsing;
- a nonblocking live service boundary that returns IDLE only before consuming
  any byte of the next server message;
- parser-safe finite-session quiesce at that same complete-message boundary.

Current Application still drives a simple one-request/one-response cadence and
has no MPEG lifecycle.

Frozen H1 evidence separately recovered:

- a calibration RFB gate that blocks new requests and remote presentation while
  frozen without destroying the RFB/PSTV session;
- one outstanding framebuffer request at a time;
- an in-flight pre-freeze response still completing protocol ownership while
  visual publication remains suppressed;
- one coalesced FULL/nonincremental request after thaw before normal
  incremental cadence resumes.

Those facts form a small RFB-owned policy seam that can be reconstructed before
the later presentation owner exists. This avoids putting MPEG/calibration types
inside RFB and avoids inventing temporary Application callbacks.

## A004 P2 Foreman acceptance

Live pickup authority was independently refreshed as:

- branch HEAD `773cdd905cde5a0c38a1e732c10d4d5f2d123c46`;
- final pre-log source/dictionary authority
  `5aa84f1dc0e3017b88214e20637ab1a0605cc38a`;
- immutable Reconstruction log
  `docs/ledge/work-log/20260920T175245-0400__reconstruction__a004-presentation__interactive.md`.

The worker landed five commits after Foreman authority `aaa452899...`:

- `7e779fdb113ee37dfda1e60f4887c7d7c608037a` —
  generic RFB freeze/refresh flow policy plus focused host contract;
- `7600d77f158892d1b850c686371cb3c9e72d67b1` —
  tree-identical deterministic dictionary-reconciliation trigger;
- `a64b6427356ff1c2fcbc87f2e40cd126048b7589` —
  automated clean-symbol reconciliation;
- `5aa84f1dc0e3017b88214e20637ab1a0605cc38a` —
  RFB domain responsibility prose;
- `773cdd905cde5a0c38a1e732c10d4d5f2d123c46` —
  required immutable Reconstruction work log.

Independent source review confirms:

- `src/rfb/flow_policy.{c,h}` contains only generic RFB live-flow facts:
  global frozen/thawed state, one outstanding request, one pending FULL debt,
  request choice and publication permission;
- no MPEG, calibration, decoder, producer, GS, presentation-owner, Transport
  lifecycle or Application type/header is imported;
- `next_request()` is non-mutating, so merely inspecting policy cannot consume
  FULL debt;
- FULL debt is cleared only after the currently owed FULL request is recorded as
  successfully sent;
- freeze while one request is outstanding does not discard protocol ownership;
  the response may complete at the existing RFB complete-message boundary and
  clear that outstanding fact while visual publication remains blocked;
- repeated freeze/thaw intent before recovery advances coalesces, while a later
  genuine interval after recovery send creates distinct debt;
- existing strict initial-frame authority and parser/session source remain
  unchanged;
- current Q7 remains possible because active/retiring MPEG is not represented
  inside the global RFB freeze policy.

A004-P2-C1 through A004-P2-C9 are accepted as MET within the packet's bounded
source scope.

GitHub Actions run `35540415181` at pickup HEAD completed SUCCESS.
Host evidence includes both `RFB_FLOW_POLICY_TEST=PASS` and
`transport_runtime_test: PASS`; project-check, strict dictionary, PS2 compile
and PS2 link/current-source reproducibility also passed.

The earlier behavior-head run retained another occurrence of the already-seen
timing-sensitive `transport_runtime_test` assertions at lines 787/789. No
Transport source changed in P2, the starting authority was green, later runs
passed unchanged source, and the final coherent head is green. This remains
test/infrastructure debt rather than an A004 P2 product defect.

No physical PS2 run was performed and P2 is not yet wired into product
Application runtime. Those facts remain explicit evidence boundaries.

## Why P3 is presentation ownership state before compositor/runtime wiring

Current clean authority now has:

- P1: one accepted immutable MPEG CALIBRATION region value;
- P2: one generic RFB freeze/request/full-refresh policy;
- A003: MPEG decoder ownership plus the settled rule that Presentation owns the
  first-real-presentation media-clock arm boundary;
- Platform: one existing PS2 graphics path whose synchronized flip is already
  the application-visible physical completion boundary.

Frozen H1 `h1_mpeg_presentation_owner` and `h1_mpeg_start_handoff` recover a
useful start-side ownership model: RFB_ONLY -> WAIT_FIRST_FRAME -> MPEG_OWNED,
with immutable region/suppression facts and stale-generation rejection.

Two H1 details must not be copied literally:

1. H1 minted presentation generations internally; current architecture treats
   MPEG run/generation identity as caller-owned exact-run authority. Presentation
   consumes that identity and must not create a competing generation namespace.
2. H1's active `stop()` returned directly from MPEG_OWNED to RFB_ONLY. Current
   Q7 supersedes that behavior: active MPEG retirement requires a later ordered
   retirement phase where RFB may rebuild underneath still-visible retiring
   MPEG before final reveal.

P3 therefore reconstructs only the start-side visible-ownership contract and
reserves actual physical composition/clock-arm and Q7 retirement for later
tranches.

## A004 P3 Foreman acceptance

Live pickup authority was independently refreshed as:

- branch HEAD `309a87851c17f65600ee1d647022cb8b6276baab`;
- final pre-log source/tooling authority

- immutable Reconstruction log
  `docs/ledge/work-log/20260920T181426-0400__reconstruction__a004-presentation__interactive.md`.

The worker landed seven commits after Foreman authority `2f16a2b9...`:

- `abe684c79cf49f856d3d72b3fe5523a815a4034b` —
  Display-owned MPEG visible-ownership core and host fixture;
- `d4035cce00d4bbef297b2018c1839767fdc2beed` —
  first tree-identical dictionary reconciliation trigger;
- `bfd2d0ffc54ef7100ea64b1fea65716a4bf04560` —
  temporary reconciliation-tool generalization after Display was found absent;
- `e6ebb4adf2280936f511612999a8793cd296c28b` —
  second tree-identical reconciliation trigger;
- `aa367034fa874d854209836e3133f45de5f68caa` —
  automated symbol reconciliation;
- `b8abd1a89f39710d99691e89e7e24ef0dcc75509` —
  bounded tooling correction preserving unsupported dictionary metadata;
- `309a87851c17f65600ee1d647022cb8b6276baab` —
  required immutable Reconstruction work log.

Independent source review confirms:

- `src/display/mpeg_presentation.{c,h}` is a pure Display/Presentation owner;
- it uses no UI/calibration, RFB, Transport, MPEG-decoder, Platform or
  media-clock API;
- one caller-supplied nonzero MPEG run/generation is copied verbatim and never
  minted or incremented by Presentation;
- one already-resolved `base / inner_content / suppression` geometry snapshot
  is copied immutably for the run;
- base geometry remains macroblock-sized while inner content is a symmetric
  presentation-local inset and suppression must contain the complete base;
- RFB_ONLY -> WAIT_FIRST_FRAME is the only arm transition;
- WAIT_FIRST_FRAME reports FROZEN_RFB_DESKTOP/global protection while explicitly
  not claiming MPEG visual ownership;
- only an exact-generation first-frame-presented event may promote to
  MPEG_OWNED, and duplicate/stale/wrong events fail closed;
- MPEG_OWNED reports COMPOSITED, releases the generic global-freeze requirement,
  and retains the exact generation/suppression snapshot;
- exact pending-start abort returns to RFB_ONLY without creating RFB
  FULL-refresh debt;
- there is deliberately no active-stop/retire API, so current-Q7 retirement
  remains attachable without an H1-style early reveal;
- the first-frame state transition itself performs no physical draw, upload,
  flip or media-clock arm and therefore does not manufacture hardware evidence.

A004-P3-C1 through A004-P3-C10 are accepted as MET within the packet's bounded
source scope.

### P3 dictionary/tooling repair acceptance

The worker's first behavior commit exposed a genuine integration defect: the
canonical deterministic reconciliation helper did not target `src/display`.

The temporary broad reconciliation then removed two maintained Diagnostics rows
for live GNU `__typeof__(sendto)` alias declarations. The worker correctly
rejected that collateral removal and narrowed the helper again.

Independent Foreman comparison confirms the final state:

- `src/diagnostics/SYMBOLS.md` is byte-identical to Foreman base
  (blob `5918063c0a27596ab558aa6160ec69856dd43e5c`);
- the generated portal again reports Diagnostics=69;
- Display now has complete coverage with 113 symbols;
- relative to the prior helper, the only functional target-set change is adding
  `Path("src/display")`;
- the workflow change only stages `src/display/SYMBOLS.md` during authorized
  reconciliation;
- specialized Diagnostics/framebuffer/UI dictionaries are not newly rewritten
  by the helper.

That final tooling repair is accepted as bounded integration work rather than
product behavior.

### P3 evidence

GitHub Actions run `35541637912` at pickup HEAD completed SUCCESS.

Host logs explicitly show:

- `MPEG_PRESENTATION_TEST=PASS`;
- `RFB_FLOW_POLICY_TEST=PASS`;
- `MPEG_CALIBRATION_UNIT=PASS`;
- `transport_runtime_test: PASS`;
- the remaining canonical host suite passing.

Project check, strict dictionary audit, broad PS2 compile, and linked
current-source reproducibility also passed.

Evidence limitation remains important: the current PS2 compile/link source
lists do not yet include the still-unwired new P3 translation unit. Those jobs
prove the existing linked product was not broken; the direct executable P3
evidence is the host fixture. No physical PS2 run was performed.

## Why P4 is the single physical compositor / first-sync seam

Current authority now has:

- P1 immutable accepted MPEG calibration meaning;
- P2 generic RFB freeze/request/full-refresh policy;
- P3 exact-run Presentation ownership state;
- A003 MPEG decoder ownership and safe-stop behavior;
- A002 one session-scoped shared media clock;
- one existing PS2 Platform graphics owner whose successful
  `pstvnc_ps2_graphics_present()` returns only after `gsKit_sync_flip()`.

Frozen H1 `h1_cumulative39_graphics` proves the required visible layering:

```text
remote desktop
-> black outer suppression footprint
-> MPEG base
-> black symmetric inner matte
-> local UI / OSK overlay
-> one GS queue / synchronized flip
```

H1 also proves that MPEG picture memory arrives in RGB16 macroblock order and
must be presented through the same physical GS owner. Its useful resource
behavior caches desktop/overlay state, reuses bounded video texture resources,
and returns video-present success only after synchronized physical presentation.

The clean reconstruction must **not** copy H1's structural shortcuts:

- no textual inclusion/wrapping of another `.c` graphics owner;
- no second GS presenter;
- no semaphore justified solely by competing graphics callers;
- no direct active `clear_video()` product stop that bypasses current Q7;
- no MPEG decoder worker directly taking GS ownership.

Current clean MPEG decode also exposes a real dependency for later integration:
the decoder owns its picture buffer but has no per-picture presentation handoff.
P4 therefore reconstructs the physical compositor contract and first-sync
semantics without yet wiring the MPEG worker or final Application transaction.

A003/A004 authority requires the shared media epoch to be armed by Presentation
at the first **real synchronized MPEG presentation boundary**, not at START,
producer admission, decode completion, upload, or a source-level state change.
P4 must make that boundary explicit and host-testable while preserving that only
a PS2 run can qualify the physical result.

## A004 P4 Foreman acceptance

Live pickup authority was independently refreshed as:

- branch HEAD `a88718833fb15a8c6fdba668daea9c9b78c960d9`;
- final pre-log source/dictionary/build authority
  `37bbd71ca5afaf3dfb63568e85f9d31dbf043d08`;
- immutable Reconstruction log
  `docs/ledge/work-log/20260920T184357-0400__reconstruction__a004-presentation__interactive.md`.

A role-error NOOP log exists immediately before the Reconstruction range at
`2f234d140213ed79d37c6bc2c228f12dfae90fdf`. It changed no Foreman state,
packet, product source or planning authority. The immutable log contract requires
that historical record to remain preserved; it is not current Foreman authority.

The actual P4 Reconstruction range is:

- `75d5c87cd47a3d8b7108d790eed890de4bbaf7b9` —
  synchronized MPEG compositor/frame/Platform mechanism and direct build wiring;
- `bbf7e52f45ec577ccd9eeea688cd4023d87d075f` —
  restore executable mode on the strict PS2 compile script after a Git-write
  mode regression;
- `25081e22864db4f09c67c10dd7c4662cfa975f50` —
  deterministic dictionary-reconciliation trigger;
- `8f147edc97219df4b59c5118566a377f0a0bd0ab` —
  generated current clean dictionaries;
- `f0e1da106035063c63555f93d2b480c36306128c` —
  synchronized compositor ownership prose;
- `37bbd71ca5afaf3dfb63568e85f9d31dbf043d08` —
  preserve legal full-inner-matte geometry where resolved inner content may be
  zero-sized;
- `a88718833fb15a8c6fdba668daea9c9b78c960d9` —
  required immutable Reconstruction work log.

Independent source review confirms:

- `src/display/mpeg_frame.{c,h}` defines one decoder-independent
  caller-owned RGB16 16x16-macroblock surface and bounded deterministic detile;
- `src/display/mpeg_compositor.{c,h}` owns exact-run coordination but contains
  no gsKit/dmaKit, decoder, Transport, RFB or calibration call;
- `src/platform/ps2_graphics.{c,h}` remains the sole current GS/dmaKit owner;
- no second presenter, graphics semaphore or H1 C-file wrapper was introduced;
- P4 reuses one maximum-size MPEG VRAM allocation and one bounded aligned EE
  detile buffer rather than allocating permanent frame/run resources;
- the one render body orders desktop -> suppression -> MPEG -> inner matte ->
  local overlay -> queue -> synchronized flip;
- ordinary desktop/local-overlay refresh while MPEG remains retained redraws the
  same composite, so authoritative RFB truth can advance underneath the visible
  suppression footprint;
- the Platform synchronized result is populated only after
  `gsKit_sync_flip()`, with `GetTimerSystemTime()` sampled after that
  boundary in `kBUSCLK` ticks;
- Display rejects stale generation or source/base geometry mismatch before the
  Platform presenter is called;
- WAIT_FIRST_FRAME can arm an unarmed session media clock only from that
  post-sync timer observation and only then performs exact P3 promotion;
- a pre-existing session media epoch is preserved across a later MPEG run;
- MPEG_OWNED frames neither re-arm the epoch nor duplicate P3 promotion;
- failures after physical synchronization preserve truthful effects while
  returning failure rather than claiming a completed first-presentation
  transaction;
- no active clear/stop API exists in P4, preserving current-Q7 attachment;
- the final inner-matte correction correctly permits an accepted P1/P3 geometry
  whose inner content is zero width/height while keeping base/suppression
  positive and bounded.

A004-P4-C1 through A004-P4-C12 are accepted as MET within the bounded source and
machine-evidence scope.

### P4 evidence

Pickup-head GitHub Actions run `35543110959` completed SUCCESS.

Host evidence includes:

- `MPEG_COMPOSITOR_TEST=PASS`;
- `MPEG_PRESENTATION_TEST=PASS`;
- `RFB_FLOW_POLICY_TEST=PASS`;
- `MPEG_CALIBRATION_UNIT=PASS`;
- `transport_runtime_test: PASS`.

Canonical direct PS2 compile explicitly compiled:

- `src/display/mpeg_frame.c`;
- `src/display/mpeg_presentation.c`;
- `src/display/mpeg_compositor.c`;
- `src/platform/ps2_graphics.c`;

and reported `CLEAN_PS2_COMPILE_CHECK=PASS`.

The linked clean build explicitly compiled/linked
`mpeg_frame.o`, `mpeg_presentation.o`, `mpeg_compositor.o` and
`ps2_graphics.o` into both reproducibility builds and reported
`LEDGE_CURRENT_LINKED_REPRODUCIBILITY=PASS`.

Project check and strict dictionary audit also passed. No physical PS2/television
run occurred; visible layering, actual first-frame timing, A/V sync and endurance
remain hardware debt.

## Why P5 is retirement before scheduler/runtime wiring

P4 can now safely establish and retain an exact MPEG visual owner, while
ordinary desktop updates continue beneath the retained suppression layer.
However, current source intentionally has no bounded exact-run transition that
can retire that visual owner and reveal the rebuilt RFB desktop.

Current Q7 requires a real ordered retirement:

1. Application closes new MPEG production/admission;
2. already accepted MPEG may drain;
3. RFB refresh can proceed underneath still-visible MPEG/mattes;
4. only after the decoder/runtime reaches its safe stop boundary and the caller
   has sufficient underlay-restoration evidence may the final synchronized
   visible handoff remove MPEG/mattes and reveal RFB.

The production/Transport/decoder/RFB proofs are cross-domain Application facts.
Presentation must not invent them. What is missing now is the narrow
Presentation/Platform mechanism that can represent RETIRING, continue exact-run
drain presentation, seal further frame presentation before final reveal, and
perform one fail-closed synchronized reveal through the existing GS owner.

That retirement seam is a dependency for later decoder-worker handoff. Wiring
the decoder into P4 first would create a runtime that can start/retain MPEG but
has no bounded owner-correct visible retirement path.

Absolute scheduler/drop is also required A004 behavior, but it is independent
timing policy and remains the next later tranche rather than being bundled into
retirement.

## A004 P5 Foreman acceptance

Live pickup authority was independently refreshed as:

- branch HEAD `8ab034addb551899c4600c64063a1e1f7db7e557`;
- final pre-log source/dictionary authority

- immutable Reconstruction log
  `docs/ledge/work-log/20260920T192712-0400__reconstruction__a004-presentation__interactive.md`.

The worker landed five commits after Foreman base
`3ce6b596a5fc0936c30ab7c31936e1a2c82c4675`:

- `05e3930a8c82a7f0c4b1080de44972028bb0fd75` —
  exact-run Presentation retirement and synchronized retained-video reveal;
- `6480038ae5ec69eae37a2af5e52ecd7972d107fa` —
  deterministic dictionary-reconciliation trigger;
- `3b8b9adc09a17fe373edf35b5416934e95e7cc8a` —
  automated current clean symbol reconciliation;
- `4367ed3b718c2740d3b3dcefb1ecd24ed93b9556` —
  maintained Display/Platform responsibility prose;
- `8ab034addb551899c4600c64063a1e1f7db7e557` —
  required immutable Reconstruction work log.

Independent source review confirms:

- Presentation now owns the exact visible lifecycle
  `RFB_ONLY -> WAIT_FIRST_FRAME -> MPEG_OWNED -> RETIRING ->
  REVEAL_PENDING -> RFB_ONLY`;
- only the exact nonzero current MPEG_OWNED generation may begin retirement;
- RETIRING retains the immutable run/geometry snapshot, remains COMPOSITED and
  visually MPEG-owned, and requires no generic global P2 freeze;
- exact RETIRING frames remain presentable through the P4 compositor so
  already-accepted data can drain;
- REVEAL_PENDING is a distinct exact-generation seal that keeps the snapshot and
  retained MPEG visual owner but rejects every further MPEG frame before
  Platform is called;
- ordinary desktop presentation continues updating the cached RFB desktop while
  retained retiring MPEG/suppression/mattes remain drawn above it;
- no RFB source/API or P2 FULL-refresh debt was imported into Presentation;
- no producer-close, decoder-safe-stop, Transport residual-discard or RFB-current
  fact is manufactured by P5;
- Platform remains the sole gsKit/dmaKit owner;
- `pstvnc_ps2_graphics_reveal_retained_video()` presents cached desktop plus
  current local overlay while omitting retained MPEG layers through the same
  render body and synchronized flip;
- retained `video_visible` and geometry facts are not cleared until that
  no-video frame has successfully crossed the synchronized boundary;
- reusable video texture/VRAM remains available after successful reveal;
- `pstvnc_mpeg_compositor_reveal_retired()` validates exact
  REVEAL_PENDING generation/snapshot, performs the Platform synchronized reveal,
  and only then commits logical RFB_ONLY;
- retirement reveal has no media-clock parameter and does not arm, clear or
  replace the session epoch;
- a later distinct MPEG run reuses the same already-armed session epoch;
- there is no generic `clear_video()` API and no ordinary
  MPEG_OWNED -> RFB_ONLY direct-stop shortcut.

A004-P5-C1 through A004-P5-C12 are accepted as MET within the bounded
source/machine-evidence scope.

### P5 integration/evidence chronology

Behavior commit run `35544856315` and reconciliation-trigger run
`35544918534` failed only the strict dictionary job because newly introduced
Display/Platform symbols had not yet been committed to their maintained
dictionaries. On both runs host-unit, project-check, direct PS2 compile and
linked PS2 build were already green; the second run's authorized reconciliation
job succeeded.

After the generated dictionaries and maintained responsibility prose landed,
pre-log run `35544987580` completed SUCCESS across all required gates.

Exact pickup-head run `35545125944` (run number 292) also completed SUCCESS:

- host-unit — PASS;
- project-check — PASS;
- dictionary-long/complete/strict — PASS;
- ps2-compile — PASS;
- ps2-link/current-source reproducibility — PASS;
- dictionary-reconcile — SKIPPED as expected on an already-coherent head.

Exact-head host logs explicitly report:

- `transport_runtime_test: PASS`;
- `MPEG_CALIBRATION_UNIT=PASS`;
- `RFB_FLOW_POLICY_TEST=PASS`;
- `MPEG_PRESENTATION_TEST=PASS`;
- `MPEG_COMPOSITOR_TEST=PASS`.

Exact-head strict PS2 compile directly compiles current
`src/display/mpeg_presentation.c`, `src/display/mpeg_compositor.c` and
`src/platform/ps2_graphics.c` and reports
`CLEAN_PS2_COMPILE_CHECK=PASS`.

The linked job reports both `ISSUE7_LINKED_BUILD=PASS` and
`LEDGE_CURRENT_LINKED_REPRODUCIBILITY=PASS`.

No physical PS2/television run occurred. Actual visible retirement, underlay
rebuild timing and hardware failure behavior remain qualification debt.

## Why P6 is absolute scheduler/drop before decoder-runtime wiring

P1-P5 now establish calibration meaning, generic RFB protection, exact visible
ownership, the single synchronized compositor/clock-arm boundary, and a bounded
current-Q7 visible retirement path.

The remaining presentation-policy dependency before connecting decoded frames to
that mechanism is the qualified absolute scheduler/drop behavior.

Frozen H1/P6 evidence establishes:

- source cadence is represented by a rational FPS, historically 30000/1001;
- frame deadlines are absolute offsets from the common media epoch rather than
  relative sleeps from the previous frame;
- late processing must not rebase the schedule and create timing drift;
- experimental NONE/ONE_VSYNC/TWO_VSYNC comparison modes are not product
  behavior.

Frozen P7 evidence further establishes the intended stale-presentation rule:

- every MPEG picture still advances decode/reference-picture state;
- stale handling suppresses presentation only;
- a picture at least one complete source-frame period late is eligible to be
  omitted from visible presentation;
- pictures less than one frame late remain presentable, avoiding ordinary
  VBlank quantization being treated as stale.

Current clean CONFIG intentionally does not yet carry H1's FPS/scheduler/drop
laboratory fields. R6 therefore reconstructs one narrow Display-owned immutable
timing-policy value and pure absolute scheduling decisions without broadening
the CONFIG wire contract. Profile plumbing belongs to later orchestration.

P4/P5 also settled one important modern constraint absent from the simple H1
single-run model: the session media epoch survives later MPEG runs. R6 must not
reset run-local picture ordinal 1 onto the original epoch and thereby classify a
later run as ancient. Instead the scheduler begins only after P4 has physically
presented/promoted the run's first frame. It derives one immutable run offset on
the existing session clock axis from that exact first-sync observation; this is
a run placement on the shared timeline, not a second epoch and never mutates the
session clock.

### Objective

Reconstruct the clean **absolute common-clock MPEG video scheduling and stale
presentation-drop policy** needed between the P4/P5 presentation mechanism and a
later decoder-worker handoff.

R6 owns deterministic timing policy only. It must establish one exact-run
absolute presentation grid for frames after the already-physical first frame,
derive deadlines from the existing session media clock plus rational source
rate, and classify each subsequent frame as WAIT, PRESENT_NOW or
DROP_PRESENTATION_ONLY without calling GS, decoder, Transport, RFB or
Application lifecycle APIs.

### Execution policy

This is ordinary autonomous Reconstruction work through repository/GitHub
authority and canonical CI.

No physical PS2 or live-Pi action is required. Do not ask the user to act as a
terminal proxy.

### Required current/frozen authority

Read current at wake, including:

- Reconstruction Contract rev 0006;
- Foreman State rev 0028;
- A002 CONFIG/audio/common-clock audit rev 0001;
- A003 MPEG-generation audit rev 0001;

Trace frozen authority
`3426f28b93de9519ca93e5f0e0aaf8b67cfca845`, at minimum:

- `experiments/media-harness-h1/h1_video_runtime.{c,h}` around
  `h1_video_frame_period_ticks()` and absolute scheduling;
- `experiments/media-harness-h1/h1_media_clock.{c,h}`;
- `experiments/media-harness-h1/h1_profiles.py` for the qualified 30000/1001
  reference profile and historical scheduler/drop fields;
- `experiments/media-harness-h1/qualified_p11_video_seed.c` for one-epoch
  absolute deadline/non-rebase behavior;
- `experiments/media-stream-exp3/generate_network_live_streaming_p7_late_frame_drop.py`
  for the presentation-only one-source-frame stale-drop rule.

Historical scheduler comparison modes are experimental evidence only.

### Required behavior

1. **Display owns timing policy.** Add the narrow scheduler under the existing
   Display/presentation responsibility family. It must not own GS/dmaKit,
   decoder lifecycle, Transport queues/credit, RFB flow, Application lifecycle
   or calibration.
2. **Narrow immutable timing profile.** Represent only the real scheduling facts:
   positive rational source FPS numerator/denominator and optional
   presentation-drop policy/threshold. Do not restore H1's scheduler-mode enum
   or its giant CONFIG laboratory surface.
3. **No CONFIG-wire broadening in R6.** Current production CONFIG remains
   unchanged. The new owner-specific timing value is supplied directly by the
   later runtime/orchestration seam. Tests may use the historically qualified
   30000/1001 reference and one-frame (1000 milliframe) stale threshold without
   declaring those values a new public user knob.
4. **First frame remains P4 authority.** R6 must not schedule, delay, drop,
   re-present or arm the clock for a run's first MPEG frame. Scheduler state is
   initialized only after the exact P4 first synchronized frame has completed
   and the session clock is already armed.
5. **One session epoch.** Scheduler initialization consumes the existing armed
   session clock, exact caller-owned run generation and the run's exact P4
   first-sync observation. It must never arm/re-arm/clear/replace the clock.
6. **Stable run placement on the session axis.** Derive and retain one run
   additional-tick anchor relative to the existing session video deadline-zero
   axis. A suitable clean rule is:
   - observe the session video deadline for additional_ticks=0;
   - if first_sync_tick is later, retain the nonnegative difference as the
     run's base additional offset;
   - otherwise retain zero.
   This offset is not a second epoch. It only locates this run on the existing
   session timeline and must never be recomputed from later frames.
7. **Absolute deadline grid.** For subsequent run-local picture ordinal N
   (N >= 2), target:
   `run_base_additional_ticks + (N - 1) * frame_period_ticks`
   through the common video-deadline contract. A late frame never rebases the
   next deadline.
8. **Pure inspectable decision.** Given the exact run, picture ordinal and a
   caller/injected current tick, return a narrow result containing the absolute
   deadline, lateness where applicable, and one decision equivalent to:
   WAIT_UNTIL_DEADLINE, PRESENT_NOW or DROP_PRESENTATION_ONLY. Do not busy-spin,
   sleep, wait on GS/VBlank or present a frame inside this policy module.
9. **Late-but-valid presentation.** If a frame is late but has not reached the
   enabled stale threshold, classify PRESENT_NOW rather than dropping it.
10. **Presentation-only stale drop.** When dropping is enabled and lateness is
    at least the configured threshold expressed as a fraction of one source
    frame, classify DROP_PRESENTATION_ONLY. This result must not mutate MPEG
    decode/reference state, Transport consumption/credit, generation state,
    presentation retirement state or EOF semantics.
11. **Drop-disabled behavior.** A valid exact-run frame is never classified
    DROP when drop policy is disabled, regardless of lateness.
12. **Exact-run fence.** Scheduler state copies the caller-owned nonzero
    generation verbatim. Stale/wrong-generation decisions fail closed. It must
    not mint or increment run identity.
13. **Arithmetic safety.** Reject impossible zero-rate profiles and use
    overflow-safe/saturating arithmetic for frame-period, run-anchor, ordinal
    offset, threshold and deadline inputs. Do not permit wraparound to turn a
    very late/future frame into an early one.
14. **Clock owner boundary.** Prefer existing media-clock public deadline
    operations and, only if necessary, add the smallest read-only clock query
    needed for tick-rate/epoch calculations. Do not expose mutable clock
    internals or create a second timing service.
15. **No premature compositor/runtime wiring.** Do not make the decoder worker,
    P4 compositor, P5 retirement path, RFB flow policy, Transport or Application
    call the scheduler in R6. That cross-owner wiring is the next runtime
    tranche.
16. **Direct build/test coverage.** Add focused deterministic host tests and put
    any new product timing translation unit directly in canonical strict PS2
    compile and linked reproducibility manifests.

### Placement / shape guidance

Prefer a small module such as
`src/display/mpeg_scheduler.{c,h}`.

Keep the scheduler platform-neutral and deterministic. Inject/accept current tick
as data for decision tests rather than reading PS2 timers directly.

An immutable per-run scheduler state may contain:

- exact caller generation;
- validated rational FPS;
- frame period in session-clock ticks;
- immutable run-base additional ticks;
- drop enabled/threshold timing fact.

Do not store or mutate decoder buffers, frame surfaces, Presentation ownership
state, Transport state or GS resources.

### Acceptance criteria

- `A004-P6-C1 OWNER_BOUNDARY`: timing policy is Display-owned and independent
  of GS, decoder, Transport, RFB, calibration and Application lifecycle.
- `A004-P6-C2 NARROW_PROFILE`: rational FPS/drop facts are explicit without
  restoring H1 scheduler modes or widening CONFIG wire authority.
- `A004-P6-C3 FIRST_FRAME_BOUNDARY`: scheduler cannot schedule/drop/arm the
  first frame and initializes only from an already-armed clock plus exact P4
  first-sync observation.
- `A004-P6-C4 SESSION_AXIS`: one immutable run offset is derived on the
  existing session timeline; no new epoch/re-arm occurs, including later runs.
- `A004-P6-C5 ABSOLUTE_GRID`: subsequent deadlines remain anchored to
  run-base + ordinal*period and do not drift/rebase after lateness.
- `A004-P6-C6 DECISION_SEMANTICS`: early, on-time and slightly-late frames
  produce deterministic WAIT/PRESENT classifications with inspectable deadline
  and lateness.
- `A004-P6-C7 PRESENTATION_ONLY_DROP`: threshold-late frames may be classified
  DROP only as visible-presentation policy; no decode/Transport/EOF/lifecycle
  fact is changed.
- `A004-P6-C8 DROP_DISABLED`: disabled drop never suppresses a valid frame.
- `A004-P6-C9 EXACT_RUN_FENCE`: stale/wrong generation fails closed and run
  identity is never minted by the scheduler.
- `A004-P6-C10 ARITHMETIC_SAFETY`: invalid rate/threshold/ordinal and overflow
  cases cannot wrap timing calculations.
- `A004-P6-C11 NO_RUNTIME_WIRING`: current compositor/retirement/decoder/RFB/
  Transport/Application call graph remains unwired to the new policy.
- `A004-P6-C12 CLEAN_EVIDENCE`: focused/full host tests, project/dictionary
  checks, direct PS2 compile and linked reproducibility pass on exact final
  source; hardware timing qualification remains separate.

### Explicit non-goals

Do not implement in P6:

- decoder-worker -> scheduler/compositor frame handoff;
- actual thread sleep/VBlank wait loop;
- changes to P4 first-frame presentation/clock-arm behavior;
- changes to P5 retirement/final reveal;
- public CONFIG protocol expansion for FPS/drop fields;
- Transport START/RETIRE, Pi producer or residual finalization;
- P2/RFB runtime orchestration;
- final Application activation/retirement/failure transaction;
- physical A/V timing qualification.

### Worker return

Return:

- exact current/frozen timing evidence inspected;
- exact source/test/build/dictionary commits changed;
- timing-profile and per-run scheduler-state shape;
- exact first-sync-to-session-axis anchor rule;
- exact frame-period/deadline/drop arithmetic;
- confirmation first frame remains solely P4 authority;
- confirmation session clock is never re-armed/replaced;
- confirmation drop is presentation-only and does not alter decoder/Transport/
  EOF/lifecycle facts;
- A004-P6-C1 through C12 disposition;
- focused/full/direct-PS2 evidence;
- evidence gaps/hardware non-claims;
- exact next dependency/baton point.

Emit exactly one immutable Reconstruction log using:

- ROLE_KEY=`reconstruction`
- WORK_ITEM_KEY=`a004-presentation`
- WORKER_KEY=`interactive`

Do not begin decoder-worker runtime handoff or final Application orchestration in
the same shift.

## Deferred dependency graph

Expected remaining work after active P6 is:

1. explicit decoded-frame runtime handoff from the MPEG worker through the
   absolute scheduler into the sole P4 compositor, preserving P5 drain/seal
   retirement boundaries and decoder-safe-stop semantics;
2. final Application orchestration consuming A003 plus P1-P6 public seams,
   including activation, calibration/P2 protection, START/producer admission,
   decoder lifecycle, current-Q7 retirement/RFB restoration, failure containment
   and shutdown ordering.

Foreman must choose the exact next seam from returned P6 source rather than
pre-authorizing later implementation.

This is planning only, not worker authority to pre-implement later work.

## Hardware qualification debt

HARDWARE_PENDING=A004 visual geometry/matte/suppression/first-frame qualification; MPEG one-run/repeated-run stale fencing and Wire-loss behavior; current-Q7 overlapped RFB restoration; R1 product runtime where later required; final product Q4 establishment; exact product Wire service/runtime; all-guns endurance; exact product ELF; native Pi RFB reproducibility/lifecycle qualification

## Foreman next pickup

Consume the `A004-ABSOLUTE-VIDEO-SCHEDULER-DROP-R6` Reconstruction baton,
independently verify the one-epoch/run-anchor model, absolute non-rebasing
deadline math, presentation-only stale-drop semantics, first-frame P4 boundary,
owner separation and direct PS2 build coverage. Then choose the next bounded
decoded-frame runtime handoff seam from actual source.

Do not execute the packet from the Foreman seat.
